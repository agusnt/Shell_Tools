# Shell Tools
A bunch of tools written in shell to make my (and your) life easier with the
command line.

I use [Zsh](http://freshmeat.sourceforge.net/projects/zsh/) as shell interpreter,
so maybe you would have to install it (some of the scripts maybe don't work with 
bash).

## Scripts
All scripts are avaliable in _src_ folder:
* **BatchMultiprocess.sh**: sets a list of program and launch the first _x_, 
  when one finish another is launched until the list is empty.
* **Extract.sh**: easy way to extract compressed files from terminal.
* **Compress.sh**: easy way to compress files from terminal.
* **Password.sh**: generate secure password with openssl.
